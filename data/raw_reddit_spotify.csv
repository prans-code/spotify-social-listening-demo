I have recently published an updated article giving you all a deeper dive into how wrapped works, including new insights Check it out here:  Wrapped Analysis 2024   I was always curious about what range Spotify uses to calculate Wrapped and some other information so I downloaded my data over the years and compared it to my Wrapped to find out some more detailed information.   Key Takeaways     This year the data was logged from January 1st 00:00 to November 15th 23:59.   You have to listen to a song for more than 30 seconds for it to count in your song rankings.   Your top songs are calculated by play count rather than total time listened.   In your top 100 playlist only the first 10 songs are sorted by play count, the rest are close but sorted by artist.   Your total time listening includes podcasts.   Your top artists are calculated by total play counts rather than total time listening.

reddit,spotify,2024-12-19 00:37:24,"New Report Alleges Spotify Is Filling Playlists with Ghost Artists to Minimize Royalty Costs https://consequence.net/2024/12/spotify-perfect-fit-content-report/   According to a detailed new report from Liz Pelly for Harper’s Magazine, Spotify is supplementing playlists with “ghost artists” as a means of decreasing the amount of royalties to pay and increasing overall profit margins. Known as Perfect Fit Content, this practice allegedly primarily impacts playlists in genres like jazz, classical, ambient, and lo-fi hip-hop.   The PFC program, which was introduced to Spotify editors in 2017, is reportedly designed as a way to prioritize profitability — by partnering with a “web” of production companies, many of which are located outside the US, it appears that Spotify has successfully increased the percentage of total streams towards music that is cheaper for the platform to host. Fewer royalties are paid out to real artists, while payments go to the PFC partners. The PFC partners create music to be shared under hundreds of artist profiles, many of which are completely empty and generate inconclusive searches upon further inspection.   The report includes insights from former Spotify staff, such as a playlist editor who explained that many employees didn’t initially know where the music is coming from; the internal attitude became, “If the metrics went up, then let’s just keep replacing more and more, because if the user doesn’t notice, then it’s fine.”   Pelly, who has been digging into this story for years, even traveled to Sweden in 2023 to meet with staff at local outlet Dagens Nyheter, a publication that helped revive allegations of ghost artists. Their findings revealed that around twenty songwriters are behind the work of more than five hundred “artists,” and that thousands of their tracks on Spotify have been streamed millions of times. One of these artists features a “completely made up” bio.   But not everyone at Spotify is on board with the program. “Many of the playlist editors — whom Spotify had touted in the press as music lovers with encyclopedic knowledge — are uninterested in participating in the scheme,” the report details. “The company started to bring on editors who seemed less bothered by the PFC model.”   Some of the platform’s most popular playlists, including those titled Ambient Relaxation, Deep Focus, Cocktail Jazz, and Bossa Nova Dinner, are found to be almost entirely made up of PFC music. Additionally, many of the now-departed staff members believe the company could be moving towards AI running the program.   While Spotify has repeatedly denied allegations of creating music in-house, characterizing these claims as “categorically untrue, full stop,” their cause was not helped by CEO Daniel Ek, who oddly remarked that “creating content” costs “close to zero” earlier this year.   The report arrives in a time where Spotify is under extra scrutiny for the division between human-made and AI-generated products; many users expressed disappointment over this year’s lackluster edition of Spotify Wrapped, which leaned heavily into AI and felt largely devoid of its celebratory personality. What’s more, with Ek still taking home a massive paycheck, no artist on the platform comes anywhere close to making as much through royalties – not even the most-streamed artist of 2024, Taylor Swift.      submitted by     /u/WiretapStudios      [link]   [comments]"

It aggregates records from other freely accessible databases, often to their own detriment ($ 5 million in damages from OCLC after scraping the Worldcat database).     Claim not to be liable for downloads of copyrighted works instead linking to 3rd party sites (Section 230)   Has faced government blocks, legal action from rightsholders (copyright), as well as mass removal of their URLs from search results -> to the tune of 749 million and counting     My Take   Preamble:   I know this will be somewhat of an unpopular opinion, running contrary to the anarchist sympathizers and music content liberation crowds. I'm only here to provide an opinion that is (a) a devil's advocate argument, (b) from an individual who is concerned about and in favor of actual legitimate preservation of art, history, culture, etc. (preservation of expired license video games, open source, public domain), and (c) a rational take considering the circumstances.   Actual Take:   This is an unprecedented breach, almost  37 times larger  that of the now second-largest archive (MusicBrainz) and even then MusicBrainz is solely concerned with metadata.   Anna's Archive has carried out brazen mass-scale DRM subversion (DMCA Section 1201) with the added caveat that they are now (a) thinking about allowing wide scale distribution of files via their own site, (b) asking for donations to carry out said sharing of (yes, it is) pirated content, and (c) now asking individuals to face consequences, subject to their ISPS, for torrenting licensed content.   Now a potential response to the above is that (a) Spotify should have implemented far more durable cybersecurity practices, (b) that this sort of outcome is reciprocal justice for Spotify's putrid payouts for artists, and that (c) the 'means justify the ends', however I find that take extremely dangerous:     Spotify is still a genuine stream of revenue for artists and by making it free, you are undermining attempts to argue for better compensation   Providing a database with the core organization metric being 'popularity' rings hollow towards the advertised sole purpose of archiving.   Devalues licensing and the use of catalogues as artist revenue generation   Attracts other malicious actors to 'hit' Spotify for user data   (Worse of them all) Provides a breeding ground for AI generation through a massive content database   (Even worse) Puts a target on genuine preservationist efforts regardless of how much they adhere to Free Use and best practices     Now Anna's Archive is distributed, lack assets, etc., so the threat of them being taken down is difficult, but still I'm quite worried about where this goes.      submitted by     /u/ShowerSufficient4165      [link]   [comments]"

reddit,truespotify,2025-12-05 01:28:16,"No, Spotify is not trying guessing your real age I'm tired of seeing posts like ""Spotify said my age is 67 but I'm actually 17""   NO! Spotify is trying to guess the general age of your musical taste   This means it's guessing generally how old the music you listen to is, not your real age      submitted by     /u/fueled_lollipop      [link]   [comments]"

I’ll be doing an AMA today at 12pm ET/9am PST/4pm GMT, and I’m excited to take you behind the scenes of how we built this thing. From voicing the DJ to shaping the personality, working with the teams bringing the tech to life, and crafting an experience that actually  feels  human, there’s a lot that goes into it.   We can talk music, we can talk DJ, or just talk about what it’s like being the voice in your ears every day. Drop your questions below, I’ll see you soon.   --   Update:  That was so much fun! Thanks for having me, y'all! Would love to hang out here longer but I'm actually headed to the studio for some more recordings 😎 Let's do this again?   https://preview.redd.it/cpoo1wpgt7ef1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fb7e976588fe780909f795ca61f2a166def45fdb      submitted by     /u/DJXfromSpotify      [link]   [comments]"
reddit,truespotify,2024-06-05 15:30:54,"I canceled my Spotify subscription of 6 years. No one cares, but this is after all a rant.    I feel like I am listening to the same music over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over.   Wanna listen to 90s? Here is LUNCH by Billie Eillish 🤩✨️   Wanna listen to soft rock? Here is LUNCH by Billie Eillish 🤩✨️   Wanna listen to rap/hip hop? Here is LUNCH by Billie Eillish 🤩✨️   Made for you killed Spotify for me. Spotify makes me hate my music because it keeps on playing it over and over again, everywhere. All my playlists are just the same songs over and over again. I have over 4000 liked songs and every playlist is the same.    +   The algorithm feels way to advertisy. I notice that when artists are about to drop albums, suddenly I get an influx of music by that artists in my shuffles or playlists because Spotify thinks I actually want to listen to my liked songs when I search for public playlists.   +   Price hike, duh. And for those who care, a price hike with a CEO who said music costs nothing to make as a way of justifying not paying artists.    I will be honest too tho. If Spotify ever fixes their poop, I would come back, but until Made For You dies or is optional, I am not coming back.    BTW, I like the LUNCH song, it's just overplayed on my Spotify playlists, that's all. I am a Billie Eilish fan lol    https://community.spotify.com/t5/Live-Ideas/Remove-the-quot-Made-For-You-quot-public-playlists-or-at-least/idi-p/6070281   I created a post, like it if you agree with me!      submitted by     /u/Nomostrax      [link]   [comments]"
