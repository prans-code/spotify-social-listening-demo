reddit,spotify,2024-12-19 00:37:24,"New Report Alleges Spotify Is Filling Playlists with Ghost Artists to Minimize Royalty Costs https://consequence.net/2024/12/spotify-perfect-fit-content-report/   According to a detailed new report from Liz Pelly for Harper’s Magazine, Spotify is supplementing playlists with “ghost artists” as a means of decreasing the amount of royalties to pay and increasing overall profit margins. Known as Perfect Fit Content, this practice allegedly primarily impacts playlists in genres like jazz, classical, ambient, and lo-fi hip-hop.   The PFC program, which was introduced to Spotify editors in 2017, is reportedly designed as a way to prioritize profitability — by partnering with a “web” of production companies, many of which are located outside the US, it appears that Spotify has successfully increased the percentage of total streams towards music that is cheaper for the platform to host. Fewer royalties are paid out to real artists, while payments go to the PFC partners. The PFC partners create music to be shared under hundreds of artist profiles, many of which are completely empty and generate inconclusive searches upon further inspection.   The report includes insights from former Spotify staff, such as a playlist editor who explained that many employees didn’t initially know where the music is coming from; the internal attitude became, “If the metrics went up, then let’s just keep replacing more and more, because if the user doesn’t notice, then it’s fine.”   Pelly, who has been digging into this story for years, even traveled to Sweden in 2023 to meet with staff at local outlet Dagens Nyheter, a publication that helped revive allegations of ghost artists. Their findings revealed that around twenty songwriters are behind the work of more than five hundred “artists,” and that thousands of their tracks on Spotify have been streamed millions of times. One of these artists features a “completely made up” bio.   But not everyone at Spotify is on board with the program. “Many of the playlist editors — whom Spotify had touted in the press as music lovers with encyclopedic knowledge — are uninterested in participating in the scheme,” the report details. “The company started to bring on editors who seemed less bothered by the PFC model.”   Some of the platform’s most popular playlists, including those titled Ambient Relaxation, Deep Focus, Cocktail Jazz, and Bossa Nova Dinner, are found to be almost entirely made up of PFC music. Additionally, many of the now-departed staff members believe the company could be moving towards AI running the program.   While Spotify has repeatedly denied allegations of creating music in-house, characterizing these claims as “categorically untrue, full stop,” their cause was not helped by CEO Daniel Ek, who oddly remarked that “creating content” costs “close to zero” earlier this year.   The report arrives in a time where Spotify is under extra scrutiny for the division between human-made and AI-generated products; many users expressed disappointment over this year’s lackluster edition of Spotify Wrapped, which leaned heavily into AI and felt largely devoid of its celebratory personality.

A little about me: I’ve been at Spotify for 7 years, working on the consumer UX side of things. Basically, I care HUGELY about delivering software that people will love. That’s what motivates me. Lossless has been one of the most exciting (and challenging!) projects I’ve worked on, and I’m really proud of what our team has built.   So today, ask me anything about:     How Lossless streaming works   Supported devices, data use, storage, or sound quality   The UX experience   And even some Lossless trivia!

reddit,truespotify,2025-12-22 07:40:40,"Spotify’s Entire Music Library Has Been Leaked Online by A Pirate Activist Group I summarized the Anna's Archive (Hacker) blog as I can't include the url:   Blog Highlights     'Back[ing] up' close to 300TB of metadata and music files distributed in bulk torrents grouped by popularity   First fully open 'preservation archive' for music with 86 million music files representing 99.6% of listens   Recently 'discovered a way to scrape Spotify at scale'   Cutoff is 2025-07 and anything after that date may not be present   Data will be released in various stages:    Metadata already released (Dec 2025)   Music files , additional file metadata, album art, .ztdpatch files     'Downloading of individual files' could be added to Anna's Archive   Collection Overview: 15M Artists, 59M Albums, 256M Songs   Ranking the entire Spotify catalogue for your convenient mass consumption     Anna's Archive:  An open source engine for shadow libraries launched by the pseudonymous Anna. It aggregates records from other freely accessible databases, often to their own detriment ($ 5 million in damages from OCLC after scraping the Worldcat database).     Claim not to be liable for downloads of copyrighted works instead linking to 3rd party sites (Section 230)   Has faced government blocks, legal action from rightsholders (copyright), as well as mass removal of their URLs from search results -> to the tune of 749 million and counting     My Take   Preamble:   I know this will be somewhat of an unpopular opinion, running contrary to the anarchist sympathizers and music content liberation crowds. I'm only here to provide an opinion that is (a) a devil's advocate argument, (b) from an individual who is concerned about and in favor of actual legitimate preservation of art, history, culture, etc. (preservation of expired license video games, open source, public domain), and (c) a rational take considering the circumstances.   Actual Take:   This is an unprecedented breach, almost  37 times larger  that of the now second-largest archive (MusicBrainz) and even then MusicBrainz is solely concerned with metadata.   Anna's Archive has carried out brazen mass-scale DRM subversion (DMCA Section 1201) with the added caveat that they are now (a) thinking about allowing wide scale distribution of files via their own site, (b) asking for donations to carry out said sharing of (yes, it is) pirated content, and (c) now asking individuals to face consequences, subject to their ISPS, for torrenting licensed content.   Now a potential response to the above is that (a) Spotify should have implemented far more durable cybersecurity practices, (b) that this sort of outcome is reciprocal justice for Spotify's putrid payouts for artists, and that (c) the 'means justify the ends', however I find that take extremely dangerous:     Spotify is still a genuine stream of revenue for artists and by making it free, you are undermining attempts to argue for better compensation   Providing a database with the core organization metric being 'popularity' rings hollow towards the advertised sole purpose of archiving.   Devalues licensing and the use of catalogues as artist revenue generation   Attracts other malicious actors to 'hit' Spotify for user data   (Worse of them all) Provides a breeding ground for AI generation through a massive content database   (Even worse) Puts a target on genuine preservationist efforts regardless of how much they adhere to Free Use and best practices     Now Anna's Archive is distributed, lack assets, etc., so the threat of them being taken down is difficult, but still I'm quite worried about where this goes.      submitted by     /u/ShowerSufficient4165      [link]   [comments]",spotify s entire music library has been leaked online by a pirate activist group i summarized the anna s archive hacker blog as i can t include the url blog highlights back ing up close to tb of metadata and music files distributed in bulk torrents grouped by popularity first fully open preservation archive for music with million music files representing of listens recently discovered a way to scrape spotify at scale cutoff is and anything after that date may not be present data will be released in various stages metadata already released dec music files additional file metadata album art ztdpatch files downloading of individual files could be added to anna s archive collection overview m artists m albums m songs ranking the entire spotify catalogue for your convenient mass consumption anna s archive an open source engine for shadow libraries launched by the pseudonymous anna it aggregates records from other freely accessible databases often to their own detriment million in damages from oclc after scraping the worldcat database claim not to be liable for downloads of copyrighted works instead linking to rd party sites section has faced government blocks legal action from rightsholders copyright as well as mass removal of their urls from search results to the tune of million and counting my take preamble i know this will be somewhat of an unpopular opinion running contrary to the anarchist sympathizers and music content liberation crowds i m only here to provide an opinion that is a a devil s advocate argument b from an individual who is concerned about and in favor of actual legitimate preservation of art history culture etc preservation of expired license video games open source public domain and c a rational take considering the circumstances actual take this is an unprecedented breach almost times larger that of the now second largest archive musicbrainz and even then musicbrainz is solely concerned with metadata anna s archive has carried out brazen mass scale drm subversion dmca section with the added caveat that they are now a thinking about allowing wide scale distribution of files via their own site b asking for donations to carry out said sharing of yes it is pirated content and c now asking individuals to face consequences subject to their isps for torrenting licensed content now a potential response to the above is that a spotify should have implemented far more durable cybersecurity practices b that this sort of outcome is reciprocal justice for spotify s putrid payouts for artists and that c the means justify the ends however i find that take extremely dangerous spotify is still a genuine stream of revenue for artists and by making it free you are undermining attempts to argue for better compensation providing a database with the core organization metric being popularity rings hollow towards the advertised sole purpose of archiving devalues licensing and the use of catalogues as artist revenue generation attracts other malicious actors to hit spotify for user data worse of them all provides a breeding ground for ai generation through a massive content database even worse puts a target on genuine preservationist efforts regardless of how much they adhere to free use and best practices now anna s archive is distributed lack assets etc so the threat of them being taken down is difficult but still i m quite worried about where this goes submitted by u showersufficient link comments,0.1468,positive,0.1468
